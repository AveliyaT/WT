<h1>Monogatari Series</h1>
<img src="mtrls/imageebat.png" alt="monogatarilogo">
<p><h3>Monogatari Series (Jap 物語シリーズ Monogatari Siri:zu) is a series of Japanese short stories written by Nishio Ishin and illustrated by a Taiwanese illustrator, under the pseudonym Vofan. Published by Kodansha Publishing under the Kodansha Box imprint from November 2006 to August 2021, 28 volumes were published. Anime adaptations from Shaft Studios were created based on the light novels, and the first 18 volumes were screened from July 2009 to November 2018.

<p><h3>The title of the series can be translated into Russian as Stories. The series is also known by the title of the first volume of the series, Bakemonogatari (化物語 Bakemonogatari), which can be translated into Russian as "Monster Stories" ("bakemono" (化物) - lit. "The other volumes are also called "monogatari" (in Japanese, 物語), which means "story" and "story".) The titles of all the other volumes are also a combination of different words and "monogatari".</p>
</h3></p> 
<h2><em>Storyline:</em></h2>
<h3>The story is about Koyomi Araragi, a former vampire and high school student. One day, while walking down the stairs at school, his shy but beautiful classmate Hitagi Senjogahara fell on him from somewhere above. Koyomi, instinctively tensed up, prepared to take the considerable weight in his arms, and was surprised to find that the girl, in violation of all the laws of physics is almost weightless. He soon became acquainted with Hitaga's abrupt temper, who did not want her strange secret to be known to anyone. Despite insults and threats from her, Koyomi introduces her to his friend, Mame Oshino, who not long ago helped him transform from a vampire back into a human.

<p><h3>As the series progresses, Koyomi gets dragged into various stories in which he helps solve the "strange" problems of the main characters, including a lost ghost, Mayoi Hachikuji; a former basketball player, Suruga Kambaru; Koyomi's classmate, Tsubasa Hanekawa; his sisters' friend Nadeko Sengoku and the sisters Karan and Tsukihi themselves.</p>

<p><h3>Each heroine has a separate chapter with her name in the title. Almost every heroine has an element that is a direct or indirect reference to her problem: Hitagi's stapler, symbolizing a crab claw (chapter "Hitagi the Crab"); Mayoi's backpack, which looks like a snail shell (chapter "Mayoi the Snail"); Suruga the monkey's arm (chapter "Suruga the Monkey"); Nadeko's hat and jacket that look like a snake hood (chapter "Nadeko's Snake"); Tsubasa's cat-shaped hairpins (chapter "Tsubasa the Cat"); Karen's black-and-yellow costume (chapter "Karen the Bee").</p>
