<h2><em>Summary Link Click</em></h2>
<p> <h3> Using superpowers to enter their clientele's photos one by one, Cheng Xiaoshi and Lu Guang take their work seriously at "Time Photo Studio," a small photography shop set in the backdrop of a modern metropolis. Each job can be full of danger,
    but nothing is more important than fulfilling every order, no matter the scale…or peril involved!
    Unfortunately the anime has no manga because it is an original work made in China as a special project. </p>
</p> </h3>
<p>
<h2> <em> Synopsis </em> </h2>
<h3><p>It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words. In this case, it holds an infinite amount of secrets. These are secrets that only Cheng Xiaoshi and Lu Guang are able to find. In a small shop called "Time Photo Studio," the two friends provide
    a special service: using their extraordinary powers that let them enter photographs, they jump into pictures brought to them by clients in order to grant their wishes. Through the eyes of the photographer, they live through the events surrounding the
    picture and try to decipher how to solve their client's request. </p>
    </h3>
<h3><p><strong>Time lapses</strong> Every time they jump into a picture, they take a great risk. One wrong move and they could alter the future of the person who took the picture... and possibly countless other events too. So when the events they
    are forced to live through in these pictures start to become personal, it will take the utmost strength to push their feelings aside and focus on accomplishing the task they were paid to do.
</h3> </p>
